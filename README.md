# Night Vision Camera Project

This project creates a military-style night vision effect using a webcam or camera connected to your computer. The camera's feed is enhanced to simulate a phosphor green military night vision look, providing clear visibility even in low-light environments.

## Features

- **Military Night Vision Effect**: The webcam feed is processed to create a green phosphor effect with enhanced resolution for better clarity.
- **Low-light Enhancement**: The camera uses histogram equalization and CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for better visibility in dark environments.
- **Real-time Processing**: The webcam feed is processed in real-time, providing a seamless experience with the night vision effect applied live.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- **OpenCV** for video capture and processing.
- **Ultralytics** for YOLO (optional, if you plan to integrate object detection).
- **NumPy** for array manipulation.
